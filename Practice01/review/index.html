        <h1>This is a Heading(h1)</h1>
        <h2>This is a Heading too!(h2)</h2>
        <h3>This is also a Heading!(h3)</h3>

        <p>This is a paragraph(p). Link breaks here:<br>and continues...</p>
        <p>There are a lot of styles you can add to text without using css! For instance you can make words
            <b>bold</b>
            <strong>important</strong>
            <i>itallic</i>
            <em>emphasized</em>
            <small>small</small>
            ...
            <br><mark>the</mark>
            <del>list</del>
            <ins>goes</ins>
            <sub>on</sub>
            <sup>and</sup>
            on.
        </p>
        <p>You can also add quotes! For instance formal american president once said:</p>
        <blockquote>Change will not come if we wait for some other peeson or some other time. We are the ones we've been waiting for. We are the <br>change that we seek.</blockquote>

        <h1>Blocks and Inline Elements</h1>
        <div><p>A &lt; div > is a block-level element, which means it will always start up a new line and take up the full width available.</p></div>
        <span>And a &lt; span > tag is inline, meaning that it only takes up as much width as necessary.</span>
