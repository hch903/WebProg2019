# Practice01 Review

## Overview:

* Completeness: 80%
* Correctness: 90%
* Code Quality: Working properly but containing some redundancy.

## Details:
* Part (I): HTML

  * Pros
    * Nearly conforms to the reference image provided by teacher.
    * The HTML structure has low correlation with styling; Raw content can be viewed by simply removing `<style>` tag in HTML header.
  * Cons
    * The `not to mention...` line should be commented out.
    * `This is a table` can be included in the table using `<caption>` tag.
    * The heading row items of table can be wrapped with `<th>` instead of `<td>`.
    * Although not obvious, the `A div is...` line is expected to be wrapped with `<div>` tag; whereas `And a span...` line being wrapped with `<span>` tag.

* Part (II): CSS

  * Pros
    * Clear and unified class naming rules.
    * Good effort to try `flexbox` and horizontal layout.
  * Cons
    * In general, a separated `style.css` file is a more prefered way to do styling.
    * The `position: relative;` property is applied to all elements but takes no effect.
    * The `flex-direction: row;` property is a default setting and is redundant.
