            There are a lot of styles you can add to text without using css! For
            instance you can make words <b>bold</b>, <strong>important</strong>, <i>italicc</i>, <em>emphasized</em>, <small>small</small>...
            <mark>the</mark> <del>list</del> <ins>goes</ins> <sub>on</sub> <sup>and</sup> on.<br>
            You can also add quotes! For instance formal american president once said:
            <blockquote>Change will not come if we wait for some other person or some other
                time. We are the ones we've been waiting for. We are the change that
                we seek.</blockquote>
            not to mention how easy commenting is in html<br><br>

    <h1>Blocks and Inline Elements</h1>
    A div is a block-level element, which means that it will always start up a new line and take up the full width available.<br>
    And a span tag is inline, meaning span that it only takes up as much width as necessary.<br>
